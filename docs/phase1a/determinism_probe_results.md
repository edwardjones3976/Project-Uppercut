# Determinism Probe Results - Engine-Runtime Half (Decision 0002)

**Question under test** (from `docs/phase0/technical_baseline.md`): can this engine, on this machine,
reproduce byte-identical authoritative logs from the same seed and initial state?

**Verdict for the engine-runtime half: PASS.** Two independent editor processes with the same seed
produced byte-identical 10,008-line logs; a different seed diverged (non-vacuity). Executed
2026-08-03 00:00 UTC on UE **5.8.1** (CL 56057345), Windows 11, Ryzen 7 5800X.

## What was exercised

`tools/engine/determinism_probe.py`, run inside `UnrealEditor-Cmd` via PythonScriptPlugin by
`tools/engine/run_determinism_probe.ps1`. Per run, over a fixed logical tick (dt = 1/60, no wall
clock, no frame timing): 10,000 distinct engine `FRandomStream` constructions and draws (derived
per-tick seeds), 20,000 chained `KismetMathLibrary` sin/cos accumulations whose trajectory feeds back
into itself, and a deterministic walk over the canonical fighter_action machine from
`data/combat_states.json` - the same canon the validators enforce. Every float serialized as exact
hex bits.

## Evidence

| Run | Seed | Lines | SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| v2_run1 | 56057345 | 10,008 | `36F31A5668DE722A8C180541C33E5C5FBECE2D443E00B1CA2D48A0CEC9DA1B12` |
| v2_run2 | 56057345 | 10,008 | `36F31A5668DE722A8C180541C33E5C5FBECE2D443E00B1CA2D48A0CEC9DA1B12` |
| v2_run3 | 777 | 10,008 | `6E7BD76EBEA56DA1ADBF5F27DC95DA30A3E97D4E5D4931C76E3135B1789D58D5` |

Logs live under `sandbox/Saved/DeterminismProbe/` (unversioned by design - they are regenerable, which
is the point). Reproduce:

```
tools/engine/run_determinism_probe.ps1 -Seed 56057345 -Ticks 10000 -OutFile <path>
```

All three editor runs exited 0; the known Turnkey wedge was auto-killed by the runner each time (see
the runbook).

## A recorded scripting-semantics finding (probe v1)

KismetMathLibrary stream draws cross the Python bridge **by value**: a single `FRandomStream` held in
Python never advances, so v1's per-tick "draws" were constant per seed. v1's byte-identical result
(SHA `DDFB7E7AE60C0591E759233563BB08280BC72D1C07706546E87B8543DB0BD2BE` twice) remains valid evidence
of chained float-math determinism, but the RNG claim required v2's per-tick derived streams. Lesson
for the simulation core: **authoritative RNG streams must live and advance engine-side**, never
round-tripped through a scripting boundary.

## What this does NOT prove (Rule 18)

This is the necessary half, not the sufficient one. It does not prove **Blueprint actor-tick
determinism**: tick ordering across actors, Blueprint VM evaluation, and engine subsystem interleaving
under `-game` execution. That half needs authored Blueprint assets driving the same log format, and
its own byte-compare evidence, before Decision 0002's Blueprint-can-hold-resimulation question is
answered. Until then, Rule 22's C++ trigger for the simulation core remains neither fired nor
dismissed.
